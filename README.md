**Supply Chain & Inventory Optimization Analysis (SQL Project)**

**Project Overview**

This project analyzes inventory management, supplier performance, and delivery efficiency for a retail/supply chain business using MySQL.
The goal was to uncover insights that help reduce stockouts, improve on-time deliveries, and optimize overall supply chain operations.

**Business Problem**

Supply chain inefficiencies often lead to:

Frequent stockouts → Lost sales & dissatisfied customers.

Late deliveries → Increased lead times & poor customer satisfaction.

Poor supplier performance tracking → Lack of accountability.

Underutilized data → Decisions based on guesswork, not facts.

The objective was to use SQL for data analysis to answer key questions:

Which products are running out of stock most often?

How much revenue is lost due to stockouts?

Which suppliers deliver on time vs late?

What is the average lead time across deliveries?

Which customers or regions drive the most sales?

**Dataset**

The dataset (simulated business data) included:

Products → Product details, categories, unit costs, selling price.

Inventory → Current stock levels, reorder points.

Suppliers → Supplier details, delivery performance.

Orders → Customer orders, order dates, fulfillment status.

Shipments → Delivery dates, delays, and carrier details.

**Key Findings**

Stockouts: 15% of items often fall below reorder level.

Suppliers: Supplier 1 is responsible for 30% of late deliveries.

Deliveries: Average lead time = 6 days; needs improvement to ≤ 3 days.

Revenue: Top 10 customers drive 42% of total sales.

**Recommendations**

Implement automated reorder triggers for products at risk of stockout.

Negotiate stricter SLAs with underperforming suppliers.

Invest in faster logistics partners to cut delivery lead time.

Develop loyalty programs to retain top customers.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how SQL can power supply chain decisions by identifying stockouts, quantifying lost revenue, evaluating supplier reliability, and improving delivery efficiency.

The methodology and insights can be adapted by any retail/logistics company to save costs and improve customer satisfaction.
